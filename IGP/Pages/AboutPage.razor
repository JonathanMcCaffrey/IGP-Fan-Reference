                What is this website for?

            <InfoAnswerComponent>
                This is just a "yet another third-party tool" website for a video game. If you played a game like Path of Exile, you are probably already used to seeing a bunch of said tools.

                So what is <i>this</i> specific tool for?
            </InfoQuestionComponent>
            <InfoAnswerComponent>
                Ideally, this website will be a casual reference, for getting started with understanding the themes and game patterns of IMMORTAL: Gates of Pyre. That said, this tool is currently not near to achieving said goal. In the meantime, you can check out the simple calculator and database tools on this website.

                The game hasn't even been released. Isn't it a bit early for publishing community tools?

                Maybe 🙂

                This website has no association with "SunSpear Games." Beyond that, any game data displayed on this website for "IMMORTAL: Gates of Pyre" may be inaccurate due to my own human error and time limitations. Use with caution.
